The following Jupiter notebook and code was used for our APMA 4903 Senior Seminar Presentation (Garrett Brown, Alec Zhang, Aaron Zheng) for Columbia University.

The notebook was heavily adapted from a Quantopian presentation by Delaney Granizo-Mackenzie's "Researching a Pairs Trading Strategy" presentation (https://notebooks-prod.herokuapp.com/previews?key=5346083a839ff34e1400010a%2Ffabe9a1d-6c50-4dbd-a636-4218b57c206f%2Fpreview.html&vf=true). The code came from a Quantopian lecture ( https://www.quantopian.com/lectures/example-basic-pairs-trading-algorithm).

This was used to briefly introduce the audience to pairs trading before diving into the math behind it.
